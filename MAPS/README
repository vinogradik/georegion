PREPARING station data for grads:
I   convert data file to grads format using convert executable;
II  create ctl description file for this data
III use stnmap (used for grads more effective work).

Files in ./MAPS directory
.csv initial station data file
.dat data file after ./convert
.map stnmap help file after ./stnmap
.ctl description file (should point to the station data file)
.gs grads script
